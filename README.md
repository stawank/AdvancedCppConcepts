## A little bit about GPUs
-   GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are specialized hardware designed to accelerate the processing of images and computations that can be performed in parallel. 
-   Originally developed for rendering graphics, modern GPUs are widely used for general-purpose computing tasks (GPGPU), such as scientific simulations, machine learning, and data processing.

### Performance Comparison:

-   Parallelism:
GPUs have thousands of smaller, efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously, making them ideal for parallel workloads. CPUs have fewer, more powerful cores optimized for sequential processing.

-   Throughput:
For highly parallel tasks (like matrix operations, image processing, or deep learning), GPUs can be much faster than CPUsâ€”sometimes by orders of magnitude.

-   Latency:
CPUs are better for tasks that require low latency and complex logic, as they have higher clock speeds and more sophisticated control logic.
